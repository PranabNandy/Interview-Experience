4. Basic Programming Round with critical optimization:
```C++
Implement stoi function
Implement a function that converts Integer to string

üîç why you used 2 times *(mul operation) , It consumes so much execution time
üîç Why you did not use >> in place of * in some cases where you can optimize 
üîç why 2 times if the condition in the program? why 1 is not  enough?
üîç why you wrote repeated lines in the code?

At the end, he said, "You are good in programming but not in optimizing"
