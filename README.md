3. **Technical Round 3:**

```c++
1. Gate Score, NITK, Gap 1 year, LC questions
2. Qualcomm Snapdragon Performance & Power ()
---> CPUCP  ---> DCVS
---> ACG
[ M1 ] ------- SCMI ---------- [ M2 ]
---> Linux ---> cpuFreq ---> cpuIdle

 APP1         APP2
  |             | 
 \/            \/
 CORE1        CORE2

[ ---- Circular Buffer -----]
APP1 - write()        APP2- read()

I used flag = 0, 1, 0 ,1

if( flag==0){
    if( loc1 < loc2){
    }
}
else{
    if( loc1 > loc2){
    }
}

3. What is most beautiful satisfaction in Qualcomm
--> It was specific for Auto Motive SOC
--> I made it generalized for all Mobile, Auto, XR
How?
CD = {  CD_st, CD0, CD1............., CD_end }

4. DL project  ---> ok
  MLD  ( Memory Leak detection) lib
-----> could not able to explain MLD_algo ()

5. pattern=10110011    
bits of streams are coming in

6. Sign Magnitude, 1's complement, 2's complement

7.
int b[5][10];    // 1000
int **a;
a=b;
cout<<a[2][3];   // 7
---> 1000 + (2*10 + 3 )*4

int c[100][200];    // 2000
a=c;
cout<<a[2][3];   // 10

Normally,
a=(int**)malloc(5*sizeof(int*));
...
   a[i]=(int*)malloc(10*sizeof(int));
...

====================================
Think of Symbol Table:
====================================
b   ----------   0x1000  ( It has the information about b size 5*10 )
c   ----------   0x2000  ( It has the information about c size 100*200 )
a   ----------   0x333


===================================
   malloc()
===================================
-- It has information about memory created and its size



when a----> 0x1000
It will have all the properties of address 0x1000

==================================
   *(*(a+2)+3) = 999 ;
   ---> (a+2)  == 1000+2*10*4 = 1080  ---> It is matrix address 1080
   ---> *(a+2)  == 1080   ----> It will point to row address 1080
   ---> (*(a+2)+3) == 1080+12 = 1092 ---> It will point 3rd col of 2nd row
   ---> *(*(a+2)+3) == 1080+12 = 1092 ---> It will point "element (7th value)" of  3rd col of 2nd row
```
