4. Basic Programming Round with critical optimization:
```C++
Implement stoi function
Implement a function that converts Integer to string

why you used 2 times *(mul operation) , It consumes so much execution time
Why you did not use >> in place of * in some cases where you can optimize 
why 2 times if the condition in the program? why 1 is not  enough?
why you wrote repeated lines in the code?

At the end, he said, "You are good in programming but not in optimizing"

```
